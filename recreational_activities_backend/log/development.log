  Parameters: {"username"=>"Dice", "facility_name"=>"Yeoman Park Discovery Trailhead", "facility_description"=>"<p>This short interpretive trail is at an elevation of 9000 feet. It is designed to accommodate those forest visitors that may be disabled. The terrain is level with a packed small gravel surface. The trail is relatively straight and passes through a stand of mature blue spruce and sub-alpine fir trees and ends at a bench overlooking one of Yeoman Park’s small beaver ponds. Along the way there are several log benches to relax and take in the view. The Yeoman Park Discovery Trail has 7 unique interpretive signs focusing on the use of senses to explore nature. The signs were designed with many touchable features and they are accessible to those with disabilities. The natural subjects covered by the signs include Colorado mammals, wildflowers, rocks, trees, archaeology and water.

  Parameters: {"username"=>"Dice", "facility_name"=>"TYEE CAMPGROUND (UMPQUA RIVER)", "facility_description"=>"<h2>Overview</h2>\nTyee Campground is situated between the Pacific Coast and the city of Roseburg, Oregon.  Perched on the banks of the Umpqua River, its location appeals to avid anglers and water sport enthusiasts. <br/> \nThe name, Umpqua, is a surviving term of the Native American Umpqua language, and translates to \"thundering waters,\" \"satisfied,\" or \"across the waters.\"\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nFishing enthusiasts will enjoy the chance to catch chinook and coho salmon, steelhead, or bass depending on the season.   A round of horseshoe on the grounds or a walk down to the river will appeal to those looking for a more casual day.  \n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>There are two areas with campsites.  <strong>Both areas are reservation only until further notice</strong>.   You will have access to amenities including multiple spigots for drinking water, restrooms, horseshoe pits, an emergency phone, and river access.  <br>The campground also features the reservable Tyee Pavilion, which includes six large picnic tables, a long serving counter, sink, electrical outlets and a large barbecue grill.   Search for Tyee Pavilion at  recreation.gov  for further information.  <strong>Pavilion is currently closed.</strong></p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nTyee is located along the Umpqua River in southwestern Oregon. It is only one of two rivers in Oregon with headwaters that begin high up in the Cascade Mountains and meanders on down to the Pacific Ocean. The campground lies in a broad river canyon surrounded by deeply forested mountainsides. \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe Umpqua River Scenic Byway offers breathtaking views and outstanding scenery. Along the byway lies the town of Elkton, well-known for its wineries and butterfly pavilion. \n<br/><br/>\nWest of Elkton is the Dean Creek Elk Viewing Area, where spotting majestic Roosevelt Elk near the roadway is almost guaranteed. The Pacific Coast is roughly 50 miles from Tyee.\n\n", "facility_id"=>"251353", "facility_directions"=>"From I-5 in Sutherlin, head west 12 miles on Highway 138.

The facility offers a rental cabin with electricity and water, as well as sites for tent and RV camping.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe Lake Winfield Scott Beach includes a designated swimming area, picnic tables, a bathhouse, pavilions (by reservation only), a playground and trash bins. \n<br/><br/>\nDay-use hiking trails are found within the recreation area, ideal for a short stroll. A 0.4-mile trail parallels the lakeshore. In addition, the 1-mile Jarrard Gap Trail and 2.7-mile Slaughter Creek Trail both begin within the recreation area and connect to the Appalachian Trail.\n<br/><br/>\nLake Winfield Scott is open to hand-powered and electric motor boats only. Fishing for catfish, trout, perch, brim and bass is a popular activity. See the <a href=\"http://www.gofishgeorgia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Georgia Department of Natural Resources</a> for a complete listing of freshwater fishing regulations for the lake. A boat ramp and accessible fishing dock provide year-round lake access.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Lake Winfield Scott Recreation Area's cabin is a short walk to the lake, and can accommodate up to 12 people. A sleeping area upstairs is furnished with six twin beds and three double beds, all with mattresses. Visitors must provide their own bed and bath linens.<br>  <br>The main floor houses a living room with wood stove (no wood provided), dining room and kitchen, which is equipped with a refrigerator, electric stove, microwave, assorted pots and pans, utensils, plates, glasses, cups and flatware.

Fees are temporarily reduced because water is not available.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe recreation area includes 18-acre Lake Winfield Scott, which forms the headwaters of Cooper Creek. The lake was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s.\n<br/><br/>\nA variety of wildlife makes its home in the surrounding forest, including deer, bear, wild turkey, grouse and songbirds.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nSuches, Georgia is five miles southwest of the recreation area and offers a general store and fuel station. \n<br/><br/>\nBlairsville, Georgia is 16 miles north on U.S. Highway 19/129 and offers the nearest full-service grocery stores and shopping villages."], ["created_at", "2020-12-08 22:49:41.471965"], ["updated_at", "2020-12-08 22:49:41.471965"], ["facility_id", "234469"], ["facility_directions", "From Blainsville, take U.S. 19/129 south for 10 miles.
